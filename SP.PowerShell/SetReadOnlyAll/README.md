# Change all permissions to read-only.

This solution will change all permissions to read only. The script will start at the site level and change all site permissions to Read. If the site is inheriting permissions from its parent site, it will break permission inheritance and set the new site permissions to Read. It will then find any lists (excluding hidden lists) and set any list and list item permissions to Read.
